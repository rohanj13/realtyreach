## 2. Professional Discovery & Job Viewing

### 2.1 Get Applicable Jobs for Professionals üü¢ **PARTIALLY REFACTORED & REMOVED**

**Status**: Available jobs feature scope removed; finalised jobs implementation refactored to use mapper pattern

**Completed Refactoring** (October 20, 2025):

- ‚úÖ Removed `GetApplicableJobsForProfessional()` method from backend
- ‚úÖ Removed "available jobs" frontend service methods
- ‚úÖ Deleted `AvailableJobs.tsx` component
- ‚úÖ **Refactored finalised jobs to use mapper pattern** (DDD compliance)

**Finalised Jobs Implementation** (Now Architecturally Sound):

**Backend Service** (`ProfJobService.cs`):

```csharp
public class ProfJobService(IJobRepository jobRepository, JourneyProgressOptions options, IJobMapper jobMapper) : IProfJobService
{
    public async Task<List<GetFinalisedJobDto>> GetFinalisedJobsForProfessionalAsync(Guid professionalId)
    {
        var links = await _jobRepository.GetFinalisedJobsForProfessionalAsync(professionalId);
        var jobs = links
            .Where(link => link.JobDetail?.Job != null)
            .Select(link => _jobMapper.ToGetFinalisedJobDto(link))  // ‚úÖ Uses mapper
            .ToList();
        return jobs;
    }
}
```

**Mapper Implementation** (`JobMapper.cs`):

- ‚úÖ Added `ToGetFinalisedJobDto(JobProfessionalLink)` method to `IJobMapper` interface
- ‚úÖ Implemented mapping logic encapsulating all DTO transformation
- ‚úÖ Handles null-safe property access with sensible defaults
- ‚úÖ Separates concerns: Service orchestrates, Mapper transforms

**Architecture Benefits**:

- ‚úÖ **Single Responsibility**: Service focuses on business logic, mapper on transformation
- ‚úÖ **DDD Compliance**: Follows SOLID principles and mapper pattern used throughout codebase
- ‚úÖ **Testability**: Mapper can be unit tested independently
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: All DTO mapping logic centralized
- ‚úÖ **Consistency**: Aligns with `ToJobDto()`, `ToJobDetailDto()` patterns

**Removed Artifacts**:

- ‚ùå Backend: `ProfJobService.GetApplicableJobsForProfessional()` - **DELETED**
- ‚ùå Backend: `IProfJobService` available jobs method - **DELETED**
- ‚ùå Frontend: `JobService.getAvailableJobsForProfessional()` - **DELETED**
- ‚ùå Frontend: `JobService.getRespondedJobsForProfessional()` - **DELETED**
- ‚ùå Frontend: `AvailableJobs.tsx` component - **DELETED**
- ‚ùå Frontend: `ProfessionalDashboard` available jobs references - **CLEANED UP**
- ‚ùå Frontend: `RoutesConfig.tsx` available jobs route - **DELETED**

**Working Implementation**:

- ‚úÖ `GetFinalisedJobsForProfessionalAsync()` - Refactored to use mapper
- ‚úÖ Endpoint: `GET /api/jobs/professional/finalised` - Fully functional
- ‚úÖ Backend builds successfully with no compilation errors
- ‚úÖ Professional dashboard displays finalised jobs only

**Next Steps** (If Enhancement Needed):

- Implement feature 2.2: Professional Response to Job Invitations (accept/decline workflow)

   - Automated verification on profile creation/update

2. **Admin Verification Endpoint**:
   - `PUT /api/admin/professionals/{id}/verify` (admin-only)
   - `POST /api/admin/professionals/{id}/reject` with rejection reason
   - Add verification notes/comments

3. **Verification Workflow**:
   - Expand verification to enum (Pending, UnderReview, Verified, Rejected, Expired)
   - Create `VerificationDocument` entity (license scans, insurance certificates)
   - Add document upload endpoints with file validation
   - Create verification history tracking

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Build admin verification queue UI
